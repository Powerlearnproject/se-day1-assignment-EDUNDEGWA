Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies to engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain software systems. 
In the technology industry software engineering enables the creation of software systems and applications that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages e.g. C and Fortran
The advent of structured programming
rise of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed software architecture and user interface designs.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design, and implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall methodology would be better suited in the development of software for medical devices due to the need to adhere to various health regulations and policies while agile would be better for developing a mobile application where adjustments that are better suited for the current market would be done daily during development, especially for a startup. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Virtual Studio, and Eclipse
Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers?
Changing requirements during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines cause pressure to deliver software products on schedule and can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs
Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
These different types of testing are used as quality control measures to help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a field in AI that deals with the design and optimization of input prompts usually given to Large Language Models to get the most accurate, relevant, or creative response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt 'Write a professional cover letter for a help desk support engineer'
Improved prompt: 'Write a professional cover letter for an Experienced Level 3 Help Desk Support Engineer highlighting this Skills:
- Strong knowledge of help desk and technical support processes
- Proficiency in troubleshooting hardware, software, and network issues
- Excellent communication and customer service skills
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team
- Familiarity with ticketing systems and remote support tools 
and my CompTIA A+, CompTIA N+, and over 4 years of customer handling experience'
The improved prompt is specific to the level and skill set of the job applicant
